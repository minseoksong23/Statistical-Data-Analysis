### [Obsidian Data Analysis with Linear Modeling](./obsidian_data_analysis.pdf)

- **Language**: R
- **Description**: 
    - Built upon a final project from an advanced linear modeling course, diving deeper into the statistical nuances of obsidian sample data.
    - Applied multiple linear regression, interaction terms, leverage point detection, model validation, log and Box-Cox transformations, and residual analysis.
    - Utilized data visualization tools in R for diagnostic plots to ensure model assumptions like linearity, constant variance, and normality were met and refined models for optimal predictive accuracy.

## Projects

### [Obsidian Data Analysis with Linear Modeling](./obsidian_data_analysis.pdf)

- **Language**: R
- **Description**: 
    - Built upon a final project from an advanced linear modeling course, diving deeper into the statistical nuances of obsidian sample data.
    - Applied multiple linear regression, interaction terms, leverage point detection, model validation, log and Box-Cox transformations, and residual analysis.
    - Utilized data visualization tools in R for diagnostic plots to ensure model assumptions like linearity, constant variance, and normality were met and refined models for optimal predictive accuracy.

### [Mathematical Preprint Trend Analysis](./arXiv_data_analysis.ipynb)

- **Language**: Python
- **Description**: 
    - Initiated out of personal curiosity to identify evolving research trends in mathematics over the last 15 years.
    - Developed Python scripts leveraging arXiv's API for data extraction and utilized NLTK for in-depth textual analysis.
    - Conducted keyword analysis and visualizations, pinpointing emerging themes in recent mathematical preprints.
